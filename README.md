Colgate University (Summer Research 2016)

TODO:
- Support for reading multiple graph configurations from a text file
- Master score equation with different coefficients to reflect the importance of each metric 
  that we care about
- Score functions that consider loads on nodes and edges 
- Catalogue our findings (mapping results to their corresponding graphs) 

Finished:
- Score function for edge coverage 
- Greedy Algorithm that maximizes the scores
- Tie Breaker for multiple paths with max score
